Create a class called MinNumber, Write a program that can print the minimum number between two numbers, if both are equal then print Equal

			Ex:
				n1= 100, n2 = 200;

			output:
				100 is the minimum number


			n1 & n2

			possibility #1: n1 is Min
			possibility #2: n2 is Min
			possibility #3: equal
